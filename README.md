# Real-Time-Chat-Application
Build a Real Time Chat App With Node.js And Socket.io
In this video you will be creating a real time chat application complete with usernames and connect/disconnect messages. You will use Socket.io to manage real time web socket connections to a Node.js server that will allow you to communicate real time chat messages to all clients connected to a single server.

This entire project will take less than 100 lines of JavaScript and almost no HTML/CSS, but it is incredibly powerful what can be done with such little code. By the end of this video you will have a strong understanding of how to send and receive messages using web sockets and Socket.io to make any real time application.
