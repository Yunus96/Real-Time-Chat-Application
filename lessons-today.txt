I've learn't following Git Command today.

1. "git init" : this command is used to initialize git in the working directory (that is your project directory).

2. "git status" : this command is used to check if their is any untracked file in working directory.

3. "git add <filename>" : this command is used to add "file" into staging from where it get's tracked.

4. "git add . " : used to add multiply files into staging. just by adding "." punctuation.

5. "git commit -m '<message>'" : It is used to commit changes to the local repo or on github.

6. "git remote add origin <github url>" : this is used to connect with remote repo(github).

7. "git push -u oring" : this push's your all local file to remote repo.
